## About

The CSRF Exploit Generator is a security testing tool designed to assist in the identification and testing of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in web applications. It simplifies the process of generating CSRF exploit HTML for both POST and GET requests.

### Why CSRF Exploit Generator?

Web applications are susceptible to CSRF attacks when they trust requests made by authenticated users without proper verification. To uncover these vulnerabilities, security professionals and developers often need to craft CSRF exploits. The CSRF Exploit Generator streamlines this process, making it easier to demonstrate and test the potential impact of CSRF vulnerabilities.

### Key Features

- **Automatic HTML Generation:** Quickly create CSRF exploit HTML for POST and GET requests.
- **Parameter Customization:** Customize parameter names and values to match your target application.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The command-line tool provides an easy-to-use interface for generating exploits.
